    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

It's likely a judicious subset of features would generalize better. `sklearn` has a number of feature selection functions available. The one you'll use here is `SelectKBest` which, as you might guess, selects the k best features. You can read about SelectKBest \n",
    "[here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html#sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest). `f_regression` is just the [score function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression) you're using because you're performing regression. It's important to choose an appropriate one for your machine learning task."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Your answer here\n",
    "\n",
    "We began to explore the baseline idea of performance by comparing the average price to the testing set. Foe the most port, we where getting an $R^2 = 0$ meaning that the average price was exactly the same as the train model. The testing data on the other hand, had an $R^2 = -0.00312$ which is arguably negligible but its still less than zero non the less. This is because the testing data tens to be slightly worst than the training set which hold true in this case. We continued to build a linear model which further solidified the insight we gained during the exploratory data analysis phase such as vertical drop being the biggest positive feature as well as snow making equipment holding a significant amount of weight as well. A significant pice of information that we discovered however, is that skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price. This is counterintuitive because you would think more available skiable area would allow resorts to charge more right? We speculate it is negatively associated with ticket price because the resort simply experiences more customers at a time giving the resort freedom to drop their prices. While training our model, we yielded exceptional results however, after implementing cross validation and its performance on the test split, we discovered that it did not perform as well, this was due to a not so ideal value for ‘k’.  we proceeded to try random forest regressor and after using gridsearchCV we discovered $K=8$ is the best value for k. We could tune our model for the best k to yield better results but this would result in a model that performs good solely on one data set and not as good for other sets.\n",
    "Ultimately, the random forest model had a lower cross validation mean absolute error but almost $1 and showed more stability so it was decided to move forward with this model. "
